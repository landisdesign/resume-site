	CSS-2 Layout

	I figured that, if I am working with a large corporation, it may be in a
	space where it cannot manage the browser testing required to switch from an
	old float layout to a flexbox layout, or to size everything based upon box
	versus padding, or use rem's versus em's. I'm also assuming we can't do
	fancy stuff like calc(). We use the code we're given!

	Rather than using BEM, I am assuming this company is adhering to a more
	traditional cascade, tags wherever possible, classes where necessary and IDs
	to define semantic data.

					<h1>Java experience and philosophy</h1>
					<p>I started programming BASIC when I was 9, with a Apple IIe in a school computer room, and was programming in Assembly by the time I was 12. I always wanted to stretch the edge of what I could do with my computers. In high school and college I learned Pascal and C++ to write programs on Macintoshes. Eventually I learned Java because I wanted to know how JSPs worked.

					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<p>Most of my Java experience has been on WebLogic and Tomcat, creating middleware code for <a href="https://americanfunds.com" target="_blank">americanfunds.com</a>. Specific projects include:

					<ul>
						<li>Migrated to and maintained the homegrown Struts- and XML-based <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> (2004&ndash;2011)</li>
						<li>Migrated the Literature Center to use this homegrown CMS instead of its own separate Struts instance (2006)</li>
						<li>Wrote an entire content site conjoined with a DST financial transaction site, including the cross-server login status management (2009)</li>
						<li>Creating components and templates in <abbr title="Adobe Experience Manager">AEM</abbr>, writing both the Java and (at the time) ExtJS elements of each (2012&ndash;2014)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>These were done in addition to the front-end development that was my focus.

					<h2>Back-end Development Philosophy</h2>
					<p>When I first read WROX&rsquo;s <cite>Java Server Pages</cite> tome in 2003, I was struck by their reference to programming patterns. When I finally got my hands on <cite>Design Patterns</cite>, I was completely blown away.

					<p>Ever since that time I see my programs in terms of patterns. When I start seeing <code>if/else</code> trees or overly complex <code>switch/case</code> blocks, I immediately start considering applying Strategy patterns instead. When I see collections of functionality that are shared across multiple classes, I start considering Abstract Factories and Templates. Dependency injection is simply the next in a long line of useful ideas boiled down into a recognizable label and process.

					<p>For me, the second most influential book after <cite>Design Patterns</cite> is Steve McConnell&rsquo;s <cite>Code Complete</cite>. His ideas of complexity management resonate strongly with me. Looking at variable lifespans, checking the complexity of a method by counting the number of conditional checks, making names as absolutely readable as possible, using white space as a formatting tool, all are techniques I use and appreciate on a daily basis.

					<p>Between the complexity and simplicity of both books, I look for a balance between inflexibility and gold-plating. When it is simple to write for the future, I will do that, but it must be simple. If it is unreadable by the next developer coming onto a project, it becomes far more costly in the future, as lava code accumulates that nobody wants to touch.

					<p>While I&rdquo;ve been on my sabbatical, I&rdquo;ve been looking at what&rsquo;s been introduced since CG upgraded to Java SE 6. It&rsquo;s great to see Oracle taking a stab at functional programming, and I&rsquo;m curious to see how it is being adopted in the workplace.
