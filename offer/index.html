	BEM Example
	
	An article I read mentioned the Block Element Modifier method of program design, and
	it seemed interesting, so I read about BEM on September 14. It made a lot of sense to
	me, especially when considering CMS applications, so I thought I'd write this page
	using that methodology. I began work at about 10:30am on September 15, using my Resume
	page, refactoring the CSS and HTML to be BEM-friendly, completing the work in about 7
	hours and finishing at 5:30pm.
	
	This helped me grow my SCSS skills, which has been great. I just started learning
	SCSS on September 9, so I'm still learning. I expect to be using a lot of @extend and
	& in the future.
	
	I have not run the final CSS through an optimizer, so the output will likely be
	repetitive. That's one challenge I see with BEM. In a job where the developers have
	access to SASS/SCSS and a CSS optimizer, this is an ideal OOCSS methodology. Without
	those, the page weight and sheer typing time could get pretty cumbersome. More
	conservative firms and firms with methodical technology controls may not be ready to
	bring Gulp or other front-end development server-side tools into the mix, and we have
	to adjust for that.

					<h1 class="c-main-content__title">What I offer</h1>
					<p>The other areas of this site illustrate and describe my technical abilities, but don&rsquo;t give a sense of what I bring to a team beyond the technical.

					<h2>Rapid learning skills</h2>
					<p>I&rsquo;ve been creating web pages since 1997. I fell into that when my staffing partner at Aquent said, &ldquo;I have a job that requires web skills as well as your QuarkXpress knowledge. Do you think you can do both?&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;I can learn!&rdquo; and spent a week learning about HTML before going onto the job. I haven&rsquo;t looked back since.
					<p>When faced with a new technology, I absorb it and put it to use quickly. Typically I go from newbie to expert in that technology before project development is completed. When I worked on the <abbr title="Adobe Experience Manager">AEM</abbr> conversion for <a href="https://americanfunds.com" target="_blank">americanfunds.com</a>, I started with experience from a home-grown, <abbr title="REpresentational State Transfer">REST</abbr>-less, file-system-based <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>. Within three months I was bringing valuable contributions to architectural discussions with our consultants.
					<p>After leaving a technologically conservative firm and being away from technology for over five years, I&rsquo;m seeing techniques and technologies that excite me. In the process of building this site I learned how use Bootstrap 4&rsquo;s layout and utilities, SCSS, CSS flex layout, and BEM design, all within 10 days. It took me less than a week to learn about React and Google&rsquo;s search APIs and finish the application on this site, and 6 days to do the same with Angular.
					<p>I recognize that, after my time away, I will need to catch up. I posit that it will take far less time for me to do so than might be anticipated.
					<p>I look forward to learning with each new project I face.

					<h2>Communication skills</h2>
					<p>In one of my early performance reviews, my manager mentioned that I had the ability to explain technical issues to non-technical people &ndash; &ldquo;managers, team-members, clients, ice-cream vendors.&rdquo;
					<p>As facetious as that was, it highlights my ability to translate ideas across fields. I understand and speak fluently the languages of visual design, writing, and business as well as technology. The ability to explain technical constraints to designers in a way that helps them understand and accept the constraints&rsquo; <em>purposes</em>, not just their <em>presence</em>, has been invaluable.
					<p>I appreciate that each group has concerns and needs as valid as the others&rsquo;, and work to bring understanding to each group. I enjoy playing a <abbr title="business systems analyst">BSA</abbr> role, helping designers and business representatives clarify their requirements while working with fellow developers to find ways to fulfill challenging requests.
					<p>In addition to facilitating the design process, I&rsquo;m also comfortable managing timeline and resource expectations. I believe there is no such thing as bad news, only valuable information. If I see something beyond my purview that raises concerns, whether in timelines or technical decisions, I will bring it to the appropriate level of attention, so that those whose purview it is can make their decisions with all the information, not just information I think they want to hear. Once a decision is made, I will implement it to the best of my ability.

					<h2>Attention to detail</h2>
					<p>In his seminal book <cite>Code Complete</cite>, Steve McConnell makes the claim that a developer&rsquo;s first and foremost job is to manage complexity. I take this to heart, aiming to make my code as readable and self-explanatory as possible. Beyond commenting, I break up longer methods and use human-readable names and liberal white space, to help make the code readable and easier for the developers after me to understand what I&rsquo;ve done.
